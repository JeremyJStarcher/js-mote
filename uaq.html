  <h1>Unasked Questions</h1>

  <h2 class="question">What language is this?</h2>

  <p class="answer">Though far from complete, Mote implements a language called Spec2.<br />
  The author of Spec2, Jim Baumgardner, wrote the language as a way to extend a MUD (multi-user game) while allowing builders to work in a simpler language than C and not requiring them to understand
  the nitty-gritty details of CircleMUD internals.</p>

  <h2 class="question">I have to ask ... WHY?</h2>

  <p class="answer">Two reasons, really. The professional reason and the personal one.<br />
  <br />
  The Professional reason:<br />
  I wanted to learn Javascript and I've never written a serious compiler nor VM before so it seemed like a perfect chance to do both at once.<br />
  <br />
  The personal reason:<br />
  The Lady said, "That Jim guy is pretty smart. Could <em>you</em> write a language like that?"</p>
