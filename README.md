#js-mote

## What it is

`js-mote` is a compiler and virtual machine for a small BASIC type language
referred to as `spec2`.  It was written to be compatible with the scripting
language used by one of the MUDS that I build at.

The project itself as been abandoned, but there has been some interest in
seeing it so I am re-releasing it to the world.

**Don't judge me by this code.**

This was the first project I ever wrote in JavaScript and the code,  plus
the UI, dates back to a time when IE5.5 was still a `thing`.  I've learned
a lot about both web design and `JavaScript` coding since.


## Notes from the original release

Concepts used in the code:
* Infix and post-fix math notation.
* Recursion
* Object notation/Associative arrays
* Function references

Tested under:
* Firefox 1.5
* Firefox 2
* IE 5.5
* IE 6
* Opera 9 (FAST!  and updates the screen while it runs.  Doesn't "block" the browser.)
* Konq  (Minor konq bug -- some versions don't update a div unless its visible. result is the output gets 'eaten.'  It actually RUNS however.)


**OBQUOTE**:  Klingon software is NOT *released*.  It escapes,
leaving a bloody mess of quality control testers in its wake.
