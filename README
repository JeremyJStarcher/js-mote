This is a project that I started a while back to learn Javascript
and to learn how compilers work.  Its not the greatest code ever
written, but the back-end compiler and VM code should be fairly
strong.

(Check the doc directory for notes on how the inheritance
was done.  Easier than explaining it here.)

(This code is more recent that the code up on SF.  I'll have
to remember how to use SF before I can update it.)

The UI code has been rather butchered, stolen from here and there,
piece at a time, and I wouldn't recommend anyone else trying to
snag it.

Concepts used in the code:
Infix and post-fix math notation.
Recursion
Object notation/Associative arrays
Function references



Tested under:
Firefox 1.5
Firefox 2
IE 5.5
IE 6
Opera 9 (FAST!  and updates the screen while it runs.  Doesn't
         "block" the browser.)
Konq  (Minor konq bug -- some versions don't update a div unless its visible.
       result is the output gets 'eaten.'  It actually RUNS however.)



OBQUOTE:  Klingon software is NOT /released/.  It escapes,
leaving a bloody mess of quality control testers in its wake.
